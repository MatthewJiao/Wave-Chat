# Wave Chat


Wave is a web platform that connects incoming first-year university students from the same university. By placing users in one-on-one chats with other students who are either in their program or share common interests, Wave allows meaningful friendships to be formed, despite the lack of in-person activities associated with oneâ€™s first year of university.
